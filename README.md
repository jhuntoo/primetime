## Prime Numbers Table Exercise

### Usage
From the Command Prompt
```
git clone https://github.com/jhuntoo/primetime
cd primetime
primes 5
```
### What I was pleased with...
- Readability
- Simplicity

### If I had more time...
- Add End-to-end tests. i.e. Execute the console app and verify the correctness of the console output.
- Unit test all extension methods
- Perhaps wrap int[,] with a custom type like GridArray or Matrix and base the extension methods on that.
